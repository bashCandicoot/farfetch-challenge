## Task 2

A lightweight application has been requested which can extract data using the Farfetch ECommerce API. An end point containing the data for a specific product has been provided, please use this to display a list of categories which this product belongs to. No GUI is required at this point in time. https://www.farfetch.com/uk/api/ecommerce/products/12964802

## Task 3

At Farfetch weâ€™re a fast growing global marketplace and need our products to be scalable, adaptable and approached with the future in mind. We are regularly adding new languages to our site, and would like to add a solution which will display translated versions of the feature in Task 1. Please provide a presentation showing your approach, development stack and tools. Why would this be better than adding translations in manually?
